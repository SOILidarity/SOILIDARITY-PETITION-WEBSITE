In the heart of Porac, Pampanga, a multifaceted crisis is unfolding, threatening the environment, the ancestral lands of the Aeta people, and the very safety of the communities. Rampant resource extraction, primarily through quarrying, has created a complex web of geological hazards, social injustices, and governance failures.

The "SOILidarity" petition website aims to shed light on this pressing issue and rally support for sustainable and just solutions. This comprehensive platform, coded into a single, interactive file, details the environmental and social challenges while presenting a clear path toward a greener, more equitable future for Porac.

A Community and Environment Under Threat

The crisis in Porac is a confluence of several critical issues:

Geological Instability: Decades of quarrying lahar—volcanic mudflow deposits from Mount Pinatubo—have left the land dangerously unstable.[1] This geohazard is amplified by the presence of a large-scale landfill built upon this fragile ground, posing a significant threat to public safety.

Environmental Degradation: The relentless extraction of resources has led to severe land degradation and soil erosion.[1][2] This not only scars the landscape but also has long-term consequences for the region's agricultural viability and ecological balance. Furthermore, water sources have been polluted, impacting both the ecosystem and the health of residents.[3]

Social Injustice and the Aeta Community: The indigenous Aeta people have borne the brunt of these extractive activities. Their ancestral domain, a place of cultural and spiritual significance, has been encroached upon by quarrying operations.[3][4] The Aeta community's struggle to protect their sacred lands highlights a profound environmental justice conflict.[3]

Failures in Governance: The situation in Porac underscores significant shortcomings in environmental oversight, land-use planning in hazardous zones, and the protection of indigenous rights.

A Call for a Greener Future: Proposed Solutions

The "SOILidarity" campaign advocates for a series of actionable and sustainable solutions designed to create a "Green Community" in Porac:

"Quarrying Moratorium and Co-Management" Program: A temporary halt to quarrying on ancestral lands is proposed to pave the way for a co-management council. This council, comprising Aeta representatives, local government, environmental agencies, and quarrying operators, would create a new, sustainable land use plan that respects indigenous rights.[5]

"Eco-Engineered" Geohazard Mitigation: To address the unstable ground, the website calls for a "no-build" policy for critical infrastructure on the most vulnerable sites. For existing risks, engineered solutions like diversion channels and retaining walls should be implemented.[1] A shift away from traditional landfills toward modern materials recovery facilities is also crucial.

"Lahar-to-Livelihood" Integrated Rehabilitation Program: This program aims to rehabilitate lahar-covered farmlands while creating economic opportunities. The sale of extracted sand and lahar for construction can fund this circular economy. Reforestation efforts, with the involvement of local communities, are also a key component.[2]

Independent Multi-Sectoral Environmental Monitoring: To ensure accountability, the formation of an independent monitoring team is recommended. This team would include scientists, NGO representatives, Aeta community members, and government officials to conduct unannounced inspections of quarrying and waste facilities.

"Green Buffer Zone" and Comprehensive Reforestation: The establishment of mandatory "Green Buffer Zones" around quarry sites and riverbanks will help control dust, noise, and soil erosion. A wider reforestation plan, incorporating traditional ecological knowledge from the Aeta community, will aid in restoring the area's ecological balance.

How to Host on GitHub and Update Images

Here’s a comprehensive guide to get your "SOILidarity" website live on the web using GitHub Pages and how to add your own local images.

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account and a New Repository

Sign up for GitHub: If you don't have an account, go to github.com and create one. It's free.

Create a new repository:

Once logged in, click the + icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".

Give your repository a name. For example, soilidarity-petition.

Make sure the repository is set to Public.

You can add a README file if you want, but it's not necessary for this single-file website.

Click "Create repository".

Step 2: Upload Your Website File

Navigate to your new repository on GitHub.

Click on "Add file" and then select "Upload files".

Drag and drop the your_website_file.html (the file containing the code above, saved with a .html extension) into the upload area, or click "choose your files" to select it from your computer.

Commit the file: Once the file is uploaded, scroll down and click the "Commit changes" button.

Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

In your repository on GitHub, click on the "Settings" tab.

On the left-hand menu, click on "Pages".

Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".

For the "Branch", select main (or master, depending on your repository's default) and for the folder, select / (root).

Click "Save".

GitHub will then start the process of publishing your site. It might take a few minutes.

Once it's ready, the Pages settings page will display a URL where your live website can be accessed (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/soilidarity-petition/).

Step 4: How to Add Your Own Local Images

To replace the placeholder images, you first need to upload your images to your GitHub repository.

Create an images folder in your repository:

In your repository on GitHub, click "Add file" -> "Create new file".

In the file name box, type images/ (the forward slash is important as it creates a folder).

You can't create an empty folder directly, so you need to add a temporary file. You can name it .gitkeep or placeholder.txt.

Click "Commit new file".

Upload your images to the images folder:

Navigate into your new images folder in the repository.

Click "Add file" -> "Upload files".

Upload all the images you want to use on your website.

Get the URL for each uploaded image:

Click on an uploaded image file within your images folder in the repository.

Right-click on the image and select "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Link". This is the direct URL to your image.

Update the HTML code:

Go back to the root of your repository and click on your main .html file.

Click the pencil icon (Edit this file).

Find the <img> tags or the CSS background-image properties with placeholder URLs. For example:

code
Html
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
<!-- This is a placeholder in the HTML -->
<div class="placeholder-image">Image Placeholder: Aeta community or landscape of Porac</div>
<!-- Replace it with an actual image tag -->
<img src="PASTE_YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE" alt="Aeta community in Porac" style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius: 5px;">
```    *   And for the hero section background in the CSS:
```css
#hero {
    /* Replace this line */
    background: url('https://via.placeholder.com/1500x800.png?text=Placeholder+for+a+Compelling+Image') no-repeat 0 -400px;
    
    /* With your image URL */
    background: url('PASTE_YOUR_HERO_IMAGE_URL_HERE') no-repeat center center;
    background-size: cover;
}

Replace PASTE_YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE with the URL you copied for each image.

After you have replaced all the image placeholders, scroll to the bottom and click "Commit changes".

Your live website will automatically update with the new images within a few minutes.
